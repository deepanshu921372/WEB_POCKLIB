## Key Prompts & Interactions

### 1. Initial Project Setup
**Prompt**: "Create a single-page Pocklib (Pocket Library) application with video intro, search, bookmarks, and dark mode toggle. The page should show a video first, then display the main app after video ends."

**AI Response**:
- Generated complete HTML structure with semantic markup
- Created responsive CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- Implemented JavaScript with video intro logic and app initialization

### 2. Dynamic Data Integration
**Prompt**: "Instead of hardcoded data, use data from books.json file. Show all tags dynamically, not just the first one."

**AI Response**:
- Converted hardcoded book data to dynamic JSON loading
- Implemented async/await pattern for data fetching
- Created tag emoji mapping for visual representation
- Updated UI to display all tags as individual pills

### 3. Video System Enhancement
**Prompt**: "Use different videos for mobile and desktop screens. Mobile should show mobile_video.mp4 and desktop should show largeScreen_video.mp4."

**AI Response**:
- Implemented screen size detection (≤768px = mobile, >768px = desktop)
- Dynamic video source selection based on window width
- Added error handling for video playback failures
- Implemented fallback mechanisms

### 4. Scroll and Navigation Issues
**Prompt**: "Fix video scrolling issue. Video should be full screen with no scroll, then show main app after video ends. Also fix navigation - clicking links should smooth scroll to sections."

**AI Response**:
- Added body overflow control (hidden during video, auto after)
- Implemented CSS display: none for hidden main app
- Created smooth scroll navigation with active state
- Added scroll-spy functionality to highlight current section

### 5. Navigation UI Improvements
**Prompt**: "Fix navigation UI - remove ugly focus box, make it look better, and ensure smooth scrolling to sections works properly."

**AI Response**:
- Removed default focus outline, added custom focus-visible styles
- Implemented hover and active states with background colors
- Created centered underline animation
- Added smooth scroll behavior with section highlighting

### 6. Tag-based Filtering
**Prompt**: "Filter should work with tags, not genres. Show all unique tags from all books in the dropdown."

**AI Response**:
- Extracted all unique tags from book data
- Populated dropdown dynamically with sorted tags
- Updated filter logic to match books containing selected tag
- Changed UI labels from "genre" to "tag"

## Debugging & Problem Solving

### Issue 1: Video Scrolling
**Problem**: Page was scrollable during video playback, showing content below
**Solution**: Added `overflow: hidden` to body during video, removed on completion

### Issue 2: Navigation Focus Outline
**Problem**: Default blue box appearing around clicked navigation links
**Solution**: Removed default outline, added custom focus-visible styles for accessibility

### Issue 3: Tag Display
**Problem**: Only showing first tag instead of all tags
**Solution**: Changed from single genre to multiple tag display with flexbox layout

### Issue 4: Book ID Type Mismatch
**Problem**: Book IDs from JSON were strings but code expected numbers
**Solution**: Updated all ID comparisons to use string format ('b1', 'b2', etc.)

### Issue 5: Genre Filter Not Working
**Problem**: Filter was checking genre field but data had tags
**Solution**: Changed filter logic to check if selected tag exists in book's tags array

2. **Responsive Video**: Screen size detection for optimal video selection
3. **State Management**: LocalStorage for persisting user preferences
4. **Accessibility**: Importance of ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: Vanilla JS can be very efficient without frameworks
6. **UX Details**: Small touches like smooth scrolling enhance user experience
